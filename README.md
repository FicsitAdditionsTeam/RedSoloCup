Adds a Red Solo Cup to the game

Unlocks in Tier 4 with 10 plastic, 2 paleberry, 25 leaves. 
Build in the workbench with 1 plast, 2 paleberry, 25 leaves (leaves and paleberry required for the beer in the cup)

currently not much happens with the cup. You hold it in your hand. Hupefully one of these days I can figure out some animations for it. 
Future enhancements include different colored cups, as well as different beverages to put in the cup (as well as the mentioned animations)
