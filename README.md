Adds a Red Solo Cup to the game

Unlocks in Tier 4 with 10 Plastic, 2 Paleberry, 25 Leaves. 
Build in the Equipment Workshop with 1 Plastic, 2 Paleberry, 25 Leaves (Leaves and Paleberry required for the juice in the cup)

Currently, not much happens with the cup. You hold it in your hand. Hopefully one of these days I can figure out some animations for it.
Future enhancements include different colored cups, as well as different beverages to put in the cup (as well as the mentioned animations)
